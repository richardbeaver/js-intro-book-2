// Using the code from Exercise 9, are the left and right variables on
// lines 1 and 2 the same as the left and right variables on lines 10-12?
// Explain your reasoning.

/*
 No, they are not the same.

 The `left` and `right` on lines 1 and 2 are function parameters that are
 initialized and assigned values when the function is called. They are local
 variables as their scope is confined to the `multiply` function.

 The ones on lines 10-12 are global variables defined at the top level of
 the program that happen to have the same names.

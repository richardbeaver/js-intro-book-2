// What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

/*
 Exception handling is how we can deal with errors in a predictable way.
 Using try/catch statements, we can execute a separate piece of code if certain
 errors occur while running part of a program. This allows us to handle errors
 in a sensible way and perhaps avoid crashes or bugs.
